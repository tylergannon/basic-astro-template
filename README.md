# My Astro Starter

This is basically a copy of the [Astroship](https://github.com/surjithctly/astroship) template for
[ðŸš€ Astro](https://astro.build/), with a few minor modifications:

- Use the [Experimental Astro Assets](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/assets/) features
  instead of the `@astrojs/image` component.
- eslint configuration.
- prettier.
- Husky prr-commit to validate application.
